/*
 * A header file looks like a normal C file, except it ends with .h instead of
 * .c , and instead of the implementations of your functions and the other
 * parts of a program, it holds the declarations.
 *
 * To include your own header files, you'll use quotes, like this:
 * 	#include "myfile.h"
 * The above will look up myfile.h in the current folder.
 *
 * You can also use a folder structure for libraries:
 * 	#include "myfolder/myfile.h"
