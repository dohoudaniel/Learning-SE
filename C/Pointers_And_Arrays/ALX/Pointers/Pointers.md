# Notes
-------
1. agePtr = &age = Memory address of age.
2. *agePtr = age = Value of age.

# N.B:
- Note that * has a different meaning depending on the context (declaring vs dereferencing pointers):
- - At declaration, it is used to declare a variable of type pointer to something. Example: int *n;
- - When used inside the code it is used to dereference pointers. Example *n = 98;
