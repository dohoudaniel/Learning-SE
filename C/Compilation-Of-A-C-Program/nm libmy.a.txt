What does nm libmy.a do then?

ChatGPT
The nm command is another utility used to inspect binary files such as object files, shared libraries, and archives (like the static library file libmy.a). 
When nm is run on an archive file like libmy.a, it displays a list of symbols defined in the object files that are contained within the archive.

Specifically, the nm command prints the symbol table of the archive file. The symbol table contains a list of all the symbols (e.g. functions, variables) 
defined in the object files within the archive, along with their type and their address in memory (if available). The symbol table is usually used by the 
linker to resolve symbols during program linking.

So running the command nm libmy.a would display a list of symbols defined in the object files contained within the libmy.a archive file. This can be useful 
for verifying that the functions or variables you expect to be included in the library are actually present, and for debugging issues related to symbol 
resolution during program linking.
