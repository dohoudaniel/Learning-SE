This file contains the things I noticed generally:
- If you run the l command in a directory with executable files, the execitauble files are asterisked like this ' task0* ' .
- When creating a function, we operate from the main function based on the return values of that function.
- The last digit of a number can be gotten by using the modulo, % , operator.
