Write a Bash script that displays the visitor IP along with the HTTP status code from the Apache log file.

Requirement:

Format: IP HTTP_CODE
in a list format
See example
You must use awk
You are not allowed to use while, for, until and cut
Download and commit the apache-access.log file along with your answers files


Answer
------

Certainly! Here's a Bash script that extracts the visitor IP and HTTP status code from the Apache log file using `awk`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bash script to extract visitor IP and HTTP status code from Apache log file

log_file="/path/to/apache-access.log"

# Use awk to extract IP and HTTP status code
awk '{ print $1, $9 }' "$log_file"
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/apache-access.log` with the actual path to your Apache log file.

This script uses `awk` to parse the log file and extract the first and ninth fields, which correspond to the visitor IP and HTTP status code, respectively. The script then prints these fields in the desired format.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `extract-log-info.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x extract-log-info.sh`), and execute it (`./extract-log-info.sh`).

Example output:

```
127.0.0.1 200
192.168.1.100 404
10.0.0.12 200
```

Note: Remember to replace `/path/to/apache-access.log` with the actual path to your Apache log file for the script to work correctly.
