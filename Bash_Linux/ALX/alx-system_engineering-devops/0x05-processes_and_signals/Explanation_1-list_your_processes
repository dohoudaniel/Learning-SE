Certainly! Here's an example of a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes, meeting the specified requirements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ps auxf
```

In this script, `ps auxf` is the command used to display the list of processes. Let's break down what each option does:

- `a`: Shows all processes, including those of other users.
- `u`: Provides a user-oriented output format that includes information like the user, CPU usage, memory usage, start time, and command line arguments.
- `x`: Includes processes without controlling terminals.
- `f`: Displays a process hierarchy by showing the relationship between parent and child processes.

By running this script, you'll get a list of currently running processes, including those from all users, with a user-friendly output format and the process hierarchy displayed.

Feel free to customize or modify the script further to suit your specific needs or preferences.
