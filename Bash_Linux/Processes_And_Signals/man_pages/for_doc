for: for NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; do COMMANDS; done
    Execute commands for each member in a list.
    
    The `for' loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a
    list of items.  If `in WORDS ...;' is not present, then `in "$@"' is
    assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is set to that element, and
    the COMMANDS are executed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed.
