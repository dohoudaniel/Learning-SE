The default signal is 15, which is SIGTERM. Which means if you just use the kill command without any number, it sends the SIGTERM signal.

When you run the top command:


PID: Unique Process ID given to each process.
User: Username of the process owner.
PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling.
NI: ‘nice’ value of a process.
VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process.
RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process.
SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes.
S: state of the process
‘D’ = uninterruptible sleep
‘R’ = running
‘S’ = sleeping
‘T’ = traced or stopped
‘Z’ = zombie
%CPU: Percentage of CPU used by the process.
%MEM; Percentage of RAM used by the process.
TIME+: Total CPU time consumed by the process.
Command: Command used to activate the process.

To start a process and give it a nice value other than the default one, use:

$ nice -n [value] [process name]
To change nice value of a process that is already running use:

renice [value] -p 'PID'
