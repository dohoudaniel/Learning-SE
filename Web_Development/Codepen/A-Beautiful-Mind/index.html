<p class='indent'>Hello! Welcome to my first webpage. I created this webpage with knowledge from the We-Connect-The-Dots Code-A-Thon 2023. I created this web-page with HTML and CSS.</p>

<h4 class='center'>Let's talk about me!</h4>

<p class='indent'>I am Dohou Daniel. I go by the nickname, 'Beautiful Mind👨‍💻 ❣🌹🧘‍♂️🤍✨'. I shall talk later on, about how I got the nickname 😁. I am a Full-Stack Dveloper, Google Developer Expert and Android Application Developer, in development. I love coding 👨‍💻, deep thinking 🧘‍♂️, talking to or chatting with my loved ones ❣🤍, reading coding books 📚👨‍💻, and listening to good music 🎧🎧, especially Jon Bellion's musics from years ago.</p>

<p class='indent'>Now I will talk about my love for good music, and how I got that nickname.</p>

<p class='indent'>When I came accross a TikTok, there was a song that caught my attention, the slowed and reverbed version of Jon Bellion's All Time Low. I loved the song, so I decided to search for it using the Google search Engine.</p>

<p class='indent'>Then I found out that the original song that was sung 7 years ago, was much more enjoyable than the TikTok versions. So, I loved that song, downloaded it, and craved for more of Jon Bellion's song. I found a lot of them, the ones I did love, and the ones I did not also like. But in every of his songs, one phrase always stood out: - "Beautiful Mind". So I curiously decided to do a Google Search on the meaning of "Beautiful Mind".</p>

<p class='indent'>So, I found out that the term 'Beautiful Mind' means:</p>

<ul>
   <li class='emphasis'>A mind which is tranquil and serene, no matter how busy or quiet life may be.</li>
   <li class='emphasis'>A calm mind.</li>
   <li class='emphasis'>A mind that fully exercises critical thinking.</li>
   <li class='emphasis'>A mind with a beautiful heart.</li>
</ul>

<p class='indent'>Key takeaway is:</p>

<p class='text'>"A beautiful mind is one that, no matter what, always tries to love and see the best in people. It is one that tries to laugh at the little things, and smiles when in pain. A beautiful mind is the sort of mind that doesn't give up or stop living. It is a light amongst lights. A beautiful mind is a joyful mind."</p>

<p id='promise' class='text'>I always will be: <span class='text'>A Beautiful Mind!</span> and a <span class='text'>Beautiful Heart!</span></p>

      <p>After a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen is struck by lightning and falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the only "meta-human" who was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion--and not everyone is using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his life to protect the innocent. He is the Paragon of Love, and with help from his Team, he is also the saviour of Central City. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become...The Flash.</p>
