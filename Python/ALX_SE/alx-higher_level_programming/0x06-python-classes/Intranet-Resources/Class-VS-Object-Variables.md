# Class Variable
----------------											
1. A class variable is a variable that defines a particular property or attribute for a class.
2. We can share these variables between class and its subclasses.
3. It generally supports a single shared value for every instance of class even if there is no instance object present in the class.
4. It is usually defined whenever we begin the execution of the program.
5. It generally recollects the values until the program ends.
6. It has only one replica of the class variable, so it is shared between various class objects.
7. We can access these variables by calling with the class name.
8. We have to declare these variables with the help of the static keyboard.
9. Whatever alterations we made to these variables via one object will be replicated in another object.




# Instance Variable
-------------------
1. An instance variable is a variable whose value is specified to the Instance and shared among different instances.
2. We cannot share these variables between classes. However, they only fit in a particular class.
3. It generally stores memory for data required by the class.
4. It is usually defined whenever we create an instance of the class.
5. It generally recollects the values as long as the object exists.
6. It has multiple replicas, so each object has its replica of the instance variable.
7. We can access these variables directly by calling variable names within the class.
8. We have to declare these variables without utilizing the static keyword.
9. Whatever alterations we made to these variables via one object will not be replicated in another object.
