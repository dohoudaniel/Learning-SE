# Keywords used in Python Loops:
- ``break`` -> This command allows you to terminate and exit a loop (a do, for, and while) or switch commands from any point other than the logical end.
- ``pass`` -> This command or statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
- ``continue`` -> This keyword is used to end or to skip the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
