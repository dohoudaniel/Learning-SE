# Question:
- @julienbarbier42 and #Python, I have come to disturb again ðŸ˜…. Please help me here. When using the set() function in Python, what is the difference between using the '&' operator and using 'and'? Here is a syntax of what I mean:
x = set(dan & flash)  and
x = set(dan and flash) ?

# Julien Barbier's Answer
- In Python, the `&` operator is used to perform a set intersection operation between two sets, while the `and` keyword is used for logical conjunction between two boolean values or expressions.
- So, if dan and flash are both sets, using `dan & flash` will return a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both dan and flash. On the other hand, using `dan and flash` will return either the first non-zero operand if both operands are non-zero, or False otherwise.
- In the context of the provided code snippet, `x = set(dan & flash)` will create a new set `x` that contains the `common elements` of `dan` and `flash`, while `x = set(dan and flash)` will create a new set `x` that contains either `dan` if itâ€™s non-empty, or `flash` if `dan` is empty or evaluates to False.
