Let's analyze each line of the script:

a = 1024

In this line, the integer value 1024 is assigned to the variable a. Since 1024 is outside the range of pre-allocated small integers (-5 to 256), Python will create a new int object to represent this value. Therefore, one int object is created during the execution of the first line.

b = 1024

Similar to the first line, the integer value 1024 is assigned to the variable b, which is also outside the range of pre-allocated small integers. Hence, another new int object is created. Therefore, one int object is created during the execution of the second line as well.

del a

After executing this line, the int object pointed by a (representing 1024) is deleted because the del statement removes the reference to the variable a.

del b

Similar to line 3, similarly, executing this line removes the reference to the variable b, causing the int object pointed by b (representing 1024) to be deleted.

c = 1024

In this line, a new int object is created to represent the value 1024 because it is a separate assignment and not a reuse of the previous int objects pointed by a or b. Therefore, executing this line creates one more int object.


To summarize:
The first line of the script creates 1 int object.
The second line of the script creates 1 int object.
After the execution of line 3, the int object pointed by a is deleted.
After the execution of line 4, the int object pointed by b is deleted.
The last line of the script creates 1 int object.

Also, I created a Python function int():
	def int():
	    a = 1024
	    b = 1024
	    del a
	    del b
	    c = 1024

I used the Python disassembler on it and this is what I got:
>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis(int)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1024)
              2 STORE_FAST               0 (a)

  3           4 LOAD_CONST               1 (1024)
              6 STORE_FAST               1 (b)

  4           8 DELETE_FAST              0 (a)

  5          10 DELETE_FAST              1 (b)

  6          12 LOAD_CONST               1 (1024)
             14 STORE_FAST               2 (c)
             16 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

This verifies what I got from ChatGPT.
