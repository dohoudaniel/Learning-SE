Yes

# The value for the second 'id' call will be the same as the value for the first 'id' call.
# This is because, in Python, the '+=' operator for lists can modify the original list in-place, and it could also create a new list object.
# This depends various factors such as the Python implementation, the list's size, and memory optimization strategies.
# Here, the command 'a += [4]' modifies the original list in-place without creating a new object, then the id(a) after the operation will be the same as the previous one, indicating that the original list was modified.
