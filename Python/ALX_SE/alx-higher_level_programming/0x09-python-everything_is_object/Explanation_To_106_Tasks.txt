Explanation:
-------------
- In the given script, the line a = "SCHL" creates a single string object with the value "SCHL". So, the execution of the first line of the script creates one string object.   (1)
- In the second line of the script, the variable b is assigned the same value as a, which is "SCHL". Since strings are immutable objects in Python, the interpreter may choose to reuse the existing string object created in the first line rather than creating a new one. Therefore, the execution of the second line does not necessarily create a new string object. It depends on the implementation details of the Python interpreter.
In CPython (the reference implementation of Python), string interning is performed, which means that identical string literals are typically interned and stored as a single object. So, in CPython, the execution of the second line would not create a new string object, but instead, it would reuse the existing string object created in the first line.
In other implementations or scenarios where string interning is not performed, the execution of the second line may create a new string object. However, it is important to note that string interning is a common optimization technique used in Python implementations to reduce memory usage and improve performance.  (0)
- The string object pointed by a is not deleted after the execution of line 3. Here's the correct explanation:
In Python, objects are managed by a mechanism called reference counting. Every object has a reference count, which keeps track of the number of references pointing to that object. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, it means that there are no more references to the object, and it becomes eligible for deletion by the Python garbage collector.
In the script you provided, after the line del a is executed, the reference count of the string object "SCHL" that a was pointing to becomes zero, indicating that there are no more references to it. However, it's important to note that the actual deletion of the object may not happen immediately at that point. Python employs a garbage collector that runs periodically to reclaim memory occupied by objects with a reference count of zero.
In this case, since the string object "SCHL" is also referenced by the variable b, which was not deleted, the reference count of the object remains at least 1. Therefore, the object is not deleted immediately after the execution of line 3.
- After the execution of line 4 (del b), the string object pointed by b is indeed deleted. Here's the correct explanation:
When del b is executed, it removes the reference to the string object "SCHL" that b was pointing to. As a result, the reference count of the string object decreases to zero, indicating that there are no more references to it. At this point, the Python garbage collector recognizes that the object is no longer reachable and eligible for deletion.
Therefore, after the execution of line 4, the string object previously pointed by b is deleted from memory.
- In the last line of the script (`c = "SCHL"`), a new string object is created. Since this line assigns the string value `"SCHL"` to the variable `c`, a new string object is instantiated in memory. Therefore, the execution of the last line creates one string object. Also, remember, there is no reference count to "SCHL" too.

I also did Python Bytecode for this task:

>>> def t():
...     a = "SCHL"
...     b = "SCHL"
...     del a
...     del b
...     c = "SCHL"
...
>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis(t)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 ('SCHL')
              2 STORE_FAST               0 (a)

  3           4 LOAD_CONST               1 ('SCHL')
              6 STORE_FAST               1 (b)

  4           8 DELETE_FAST              0 (a)

  5          10 DELETE_FAST              1 (b)

  6          12 LOAD_CONST               1 ('SCHL')
             14 STORE_FAST               2 (c)
             16 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE
