The file below is int3.py. 
# int3.py
print("I")
print("Love")
print("Python")

Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:
- Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), how many int objects have been created and are still in memory? (105-line1.txt)
- Why?
Extensively explain
- The given hint: NSMALLPOSINTS, NSMALLNEGINTS

+ Answer
Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), several int objects have been created and are still in memory. To understand why, we need to consider a concept called "small integer caching" in CPython.

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, has a feature called small integer caching, where a range of small integers is pre-allocated and cached for reuse. The range of small integers varies depending on the implementation and configuration, but in CPython, it typically includes integers in the range (-5 to 256). These integers are commonly used and frequently encountered in Python programs, so caching them helps optimize memory usage and improve performance.

Now, let's analyze the scenario step by step:

Execution of line 1 (print("I")):

When line 1 is executed, the string "I" is passed as an argument to the print() function. The string itself does not involve any int objects.
Execution of line 2 (print("Love")):

Before the execution of line 2, several int objects have already been created and are still in memory. The specific number depends on the implementation and configuration of CPython.
In CPython, there are two sets of small integers pre-allocated and cached: NSMALLPOSINTS (small positive integers) and NSMALLNEGINTS (small negative integers). These sets include integers within the range of small integers that are commonly used in Python programs.
The purpose of caching these small integers is to avoid the need for frequent creation of new int objects, thereby saving memory and improving performance.
When line 2 is executed, the string "Love" is passed as an argument to the print() function. Again, this string itself does not involve any int objects.
To summarize:

Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), several int objects have been created and are still in memory due to small integer caching in CPython.
The specific number of int objects depends on the implementation and configuration of CPython, specifically the values of NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS.
The creation of int objects is not directly related to the execution of the given lines of code (print("I"), print("Love")), but rather to the caching mechanism employed by CPython.
It's important to note that the number of int objects in memory before the execution of line 2 may vary depending on the specific CPython implementation and configuration.

+ Question
The number of int objects created and still in memory after the execution of line 1 is 262. Can you explain why?

+ Answer
In the CPython implementation of Python, there is an internal cache for small integer objects within a specific range. This cache includes both small positive integers and small negative integers. By default, CPython caches integers in the range (-5 to 256), which means that these integers are created as singletons and reused whenever they are encountered in the code.

In your case, after the execution of line 1 (print("I")), the total number of int objects in memory would indeed be 262. This number corresponds to the range of cached small integer objects (-5 to 256) plus additional integers used during the Python startup process.

Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

The cache includes small positive integers from 0 to 256, totaling 257 objects (0 to 256 inclusive).
The cache also includes small negative integers from -5 to -1, totaling 5 objects.
Therefore, the cache consists of 257 positive integers + 5 negative integers = 262 int objects.
These pre-allocated int objects are created during the initialization of the CPython interpreter and remain in memory throughout the execution of the Python program. They are reused whenever an integer within the cached range is encountered, optimizing memory usage and improving performance.

+ Question
Does this have anything to do with the ASCII value of 'I'?

+ Answer
No, the number of int objects in memory after the execution of line 1 (print("I")) is not directly related to the ASCII value of the character 'I'.

The ASCII value of a character is a numeric representation assigned to each character in the ASCII character set. In Python, when you use a string literal like "I", it represents the character 'I' itself, not its ASCII value. Therefore, the execution of print("I") does not involve any direct interaction with int objects.

The number of int objects in memory, specifically the value 262 as you mentioned, is related to the internal caching mechanism in the CPython implementation. This caching mechanism is unrelated to the ASCII value of characters.

The calculation of 262 int objects includes the range of cached small integer objects (-5 to 256) and additional integers used during the Python startup process, as mentioned in my previous response. It is a characteristic of how CPython optimizes memory usage by reusing these pre-allocated int objects.

So, to clarify, the ASCII value of 'I' is not directly involved in determining the number of int objects in memory after executing print("I").

+ Question
What is a cache? Is it simply an address in memory?

+ Answer
In computer science, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data to serve future requests more quickly. It is a high-speed storage mechanism that lies closer to the CPU or the execution environment, providing faster access to frequently accessed data.

In the context of CPython's small integer caching, the cache refers to a specific area in memory where a range of small integer objects is stored. It is not just an address in memory but rather a dedicated space that holds these pre-allocated small integer objects.

The purpose of the cache is to optimize memory usage and improve performance by reusing these frequently used small integer objects. Instead of creating new `int` objects every time a small integer is encountered, Python checks the cache first to see if the required integer value is already available. If it is, Python simply returns a reference to the existing object from the cache instead of allocating new memory.

The cache mechanism helps reduce memory overhead by reusing these commonly used small integer objects and avoids the need for repeated object creation and deallocation.

It's important to note that the specific implementation details of the cache, including its size, organization, and behavior, can vary depending on the Python interpreter and its configuration.

So, the cache is not just an address in memory but rather a dedicated storage mechanism that holds pre-allocated small integer objects to optimize memory usage and improve performance.

Here's the Python Bytecode for this task:

	def pr():
	    print("I")
	    print("Love")
	    print("Python")

>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis(pr)
  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('I')
              4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
              6 POP_TOP

  3           8 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
             10 LOAD_CONST               2 ('Love')
             12 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             14 POP_TOP

  4          16 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
             18 LOAD_CONST               3 ('Python')
             20 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             22 POP_TOP
             24 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             26 RETURN_VALUE


In total, it is 262 int objects created after the execution of the first line.
