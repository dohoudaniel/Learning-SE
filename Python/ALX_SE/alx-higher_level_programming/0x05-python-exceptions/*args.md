In Python, *args is a special syntax used in function definitions to represent an arbitrary number of positional arguments. When a function is defined with *args in the parameter list, it means that the function can accept any number of positional arguments, including zero.

The *args syntax is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, which is useful when you don't know how many arguments the function will receive in advance. The *args parameter captures all the positional arguments passed to the function and packs them into a tuple.

Here's an example of how to use *args in a function definition:
	def my_function(*args):
    		for arg in args:
        	print(arg)

	my_function('Hello', 'World', '!')
In this example, my_function accepts any number of positional arguments using the *args syntax. When the function is called with three arguments, those arguments are packed into a tuple and passed to the function. The function then loops over the tuple and prints each argument.

The output of this code will be:
	Hello
	World
	!

Note that *args is just a naming convention and you can use any valid variable name preceded by the asterisk * to represent the variable number of positional arguments.
