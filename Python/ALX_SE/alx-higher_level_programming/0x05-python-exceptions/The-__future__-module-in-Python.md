The __future__ module in Python provides a way to enable new language features that are not compatible with the current version of Python. It allows programmers to use features that are planned to be introduced in future versions of Python, but are not yet available in the current version.

By importing the __future__ module and using its available features as statement, Python interpreter will know that you're using the feature and will enable the appropriate behavior for that feature.

For example, if you want to use Python 3.x's print function in Python 2.x, you can add the following import statement at the beginning of your script:
	from __future__ import print_function

This will enable the Python 3.x print function, which has a different syntax than the Python 2.x print statement. Similarly, there are other features that can be enabled using the __future__ module, such as division behavior, unicode literals, and absolute imports.

It is important to note that the __future__ statements should always be placed at the beginning of the Python script or module, before any other import statements or code, as they affect the way the interpreter reads and executes the code.
