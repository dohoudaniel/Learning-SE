# ChatGPT - List of Python BuiltIn Exceptions

Sure, here is a comprehensive list of all built-in exceptions in Python as of version 3.10:

- BaseException
- Exception
- ArithmeticError
- AssertionError
- AttributeError
- BufferError
- EOFError
- ImportError
- LookupError
- MemoryError
- NameError
- OSError
- ReferenceError
- RuntimeError
- StopIteration
- SyntaxError
- SystemError
- TypeError
- ValueError
- Warning
- DeprecationWarning
- PendingDeprecationWarning
- RuntimeWarning
- SyntaxWarning
- UserWarning
- FutureWarning
- ImportWarning
- UnicodeError
- BytesWarning
- ResourceWarning

- Some of these exceptions are base classes that are not intended to be directly raised, but rather serve as ancestors for more specific exceptions. For example, ArithmeticError is a base class for exceptions like ZeroDivisionError and OverflowError.

- It's worth noting that new built-in exceptions can be added in future Python versions, and some exceptions may be removed or changed in their behavior.
