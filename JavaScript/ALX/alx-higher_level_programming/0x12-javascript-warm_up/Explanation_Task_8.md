# ChatGPT's explanation to task 8:
- Hello! This is a JavaScript code that creates a square matrix of "X" characters with a specified size. Here is a line-by-line explanation:

- #!/usr/bin/node: This is called a shebang and is used in Unix-based operating systems to specify the interpreter for the script. In this case, it indicates that the script should be run with Node.js.

- const size = Math.floor(Number(process.argv[2]));: This line declares a constant variable named size, which is assigned the value of the first command-line argument passed to the script, rounded down to the nearest integer using Math.floor(). The Number() function is used to convert the argument from a string to a number. process.argv is an array that contains the command-line arguments passed to the script, with the first element being the path to the Node.js executable and the second element being the path to the script.

- if (isNaN(size)) { console.log('Missing size'); }: This line checks if size is not a number using the isNaN() function. If size is not a number, it prints the message "Missing size" to the console using console.log().

- else {: This line marks the beginning of an else block.

- for (let r = 0; r < size; r++) {: This line declares a for loop that iterates r from 0 to size - 1, incrementing r by 1 on each iteration.

- let row = '';: This line declares a variable named row and initializes it to an empty string.

- for (let c = 0; c < size; c++) row += 'X';: This line declares another for loop that iterates c from 0 to size - 1, incrementing c by 1 on each iteration. Inside the loop, it appends the character "X" to the row string.

- console.log(row);: This line prints the row string to the console, which contains size number of "X" characters.

- }: This line marks the end of the for loop.

- The end result of this code is a square matrix of "X" characters with a size specified by the user as the first command-line argument.
