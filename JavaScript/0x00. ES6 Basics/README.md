In this directory, I will be practicing and learning the basics of ES6 JavaScript.
<br>
Most of the resources and code are attributed to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/">MDN</a>.

The concepts I learned in this project are:
- Variable Declaration
- Hoisting of Variables
- Classes and Constructors
- JavaScript Objects
- Inheritance
- JavaScript Encapsulation
- Object Prototypes
- JavaScript Closures
- Lexical Scoping
- Scoping With Curly Braces
